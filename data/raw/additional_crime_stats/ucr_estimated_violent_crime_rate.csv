		,1. The figures shown in this column for the offense of rape were estimated using the legacy UCR definition of rape - previously known as "Forcible" rape.  See UCR Offense Definitions for further information.
		
		,2. The figures shown in this column for the offense of rape were estimated using the revised Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) definition of rape. In December 2011 the UCR program changed its definition of SRS rape to this revised definition. This change can be seen in the UCR data starting in 2013. Prior to 2013 this column will be blank. See UCR Offense Definitions for further information.

,,"Florida - "
 
,,"Reporting problems at the state resulted in no usable 1988 data.  The state total was estimated by updating previous valid annual totals for individual jurisdictions, subdivided by population group.  Percent changes for each offense within each population group of the geographic division in which the state resides was applied to the previous valid annual totals.  The state total was compiled from the sums of the population group estimates." 
,,"The state UCR Program was unable to provide complete 1996 offense figures in accordance with UCR guidelines.  The state UCR Program was able to provide an aggregated state total and data were received from 94 individual Florida agencies."  
 
,,"Illinois - "
 
,,"The state UCR Program was unable to provide 1985-current forcible rape figures in accordance with national UCR Program guidelines.  The rape totals were estimated using national rates per 100,000 inhabitants within the eight population groups and assigning the forcible rape volumes proportionally to the state.  Rockford, Illinois, has provided valid forcible rape counts as of 2006." 
,,"For 1993 state NIBRS conversion efforts resulted in estimation for Illinois.  Since valid annual totals were available for approximately 60 Illinois agencies, those counts were maintained.  The counts for the remaining jurisdictions were replaced with the most recent valid annual totals or were generated using standard estimation procedures.  The results of all sources were then combined to arrive at the 1993 state total for Illinois." 
,,"For 1994 state NIBRS conversion efforts resulted in estimation for Illinois.  Illinois totals were generated using only the valid crime rates for the East North Central Division.  Within each population group, the state's offense totals were estimated based on the rate per 100,000 inhabitants within the remainder of the division.  " 
,,"For 1996-current, the state UCR Program was unable to provide complete offense figures in accordance with UCR guidelines.  Valid Part I counts were available for most of the largest cities (100,000 and over in population).  For other agencies, the only available counts generated by the Illinois State Program were state totals based upon an incident-level system without indication of multiple offenses recorded within single incidents.  Therefore, the UCR Hierarchy Rule could not be applied in order to convert the state's data to Summary Reporting System data.  (The Hierarchy Rule requires that only the most serious offense in a multiple-offense criminal incident is counted.)  To arrive at a comparable state estimate to be included in national compilations, the Illinois State Program's state totals (which were inflated because of the nonapplication of the Hierarchy Rule) were reduced by the proportion of multiple offenses reported within single incidents in the NIBRS database.  Valid totals for the large cities were excluded from the reduction process."  
 
,,"Iowa - NIBRS conversion efforts resulted in estimation for Iowa in 1991.  State totals were estimated by updating previous valid annual totals for individual jurisdictions, subdivided by population group.  Percent changes for each offense within each population group of the West North Central Division were applied to the previous valid annual totals.  The state totals were compiled from the sums of the population group estimates."
