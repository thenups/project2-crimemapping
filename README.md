# Project 2: School Shootings, Violent Crimes, cause and effect?

## Team: functional vice()

### Overview
School shootings have become more commonplace than we ever imagined in todays society. We wanted to explore if there is any correlation between violent crimes and school shootings. While, this a narrow scope, we plan to look at data from 1990 to 2014. Hopefully, through visualizing violent crime vs. school shooting over time, we will be able to draw some conclusions about whether or not violent crime is a precursor to school shootings.

### Datasets
